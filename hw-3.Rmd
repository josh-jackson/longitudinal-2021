1. Rerun the model from question #2 from homework #2 in brms. Compare the output with the lme4 model.

2. What are the priors on this model? Graph one of them and explain what the distributions means about what you expect to happen.

3. Get the posterior samples into a dataframe. What does this dataframe contain? To answer describe why are there the number of rows there, why that many columns? What do each of the columns represent?

4. Graph the distribution of random effects of the slope parameter. Interpret what this graph tells you.

5. Change the default priors of this model to something that a) regularizes the model i.e. centered around zero and b) that does the opposite, one that is wildly wrong/optimistic about the effects. What happens in each of these models?
